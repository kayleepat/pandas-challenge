# pandas-challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to interpret school testing data. Several comparisons were done across all schools within the given school district to find trends in what does and does not impact student test scores.

## Analysis
- Data shows that charter schools perform far better than district schools
- Smaller schools tend to perform better than larger ones
- Scores tend to be consistent across all grades in each school
- Higher budget per capita does not seem to improve test scores
